Title: Use of Digital Technology to Calculate Water Footprints for Different Daily-Use Items

Freshwater has always been a silent companion to human progress — invisible in products, hidden in supply chains, and rarely accounted for in daily decisions. As groundwater levels fall and pollution thickens the rivers, understanding how much water goes into making the things we use every day has become essential.

This project develops a digital water-footprint assessment system that helps users instantly find out how much water is consumed to produce common products such as food, clothing, and packaged goods. The system blends AI-powered image recognition, a curated water-footprint database, and cloud-based analytics to deliver accurate results through a simple, user-friendly interface.

Users can scan a product, search by name, or browse categories to see its water footprint, along with insights about sustainable alternatives. To ensure scalability and trust, the architecture uses Big Data pipelines for dataset processing and Blockchain logging for tamper-proof footprint records.

By making complex environmental data accessible to everyday citizens — in multiple Indian languages — this project encourages informed choices, promotes sustainability awareness, and supports responsible water usage across communities.
